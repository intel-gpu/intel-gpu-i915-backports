	/*
	 * Track whether the pages are coherent with the GPU if reading or
	 * writing through the CPU caches. The largely depends on the
	 * @cache_level setting.
	 *
	 * On platforms which don't have the shared LLC(HAS_SNOOP), like on Atom
	 * platforms, coherency must be explicitly requested with some special
	 * GTT caching bits(see enum i915_cache_level). When enabling coherency
	 * it does come at a performance and power cost on such platforms. On
	 * the flip side the kernel does not need to manually flush any buffers
	 * which need to be coherent with the GPU, if the object is not coherent
	 * i.e @cache_coherent is zero.
	 *
	 * On platforms that share the LLC with the CPU(HAS_LLC), all GT memory
	 * access will automatically snoop the CPU caches(even with CACHE_NONE).
	 * The one exception is when dealing with the display engine, like with
	 * scanout surfaces. To handle this the kernel will always flush the
	 * surface out of the CPU caches when preparing it for scanout.  Also
	 * note that since scanout surfaces are only ever read by the display
	 * engine we only need to care about flushing any writes through the CPU
	 * cache, reads on the other hand will always be coherent.
	 *
	 * Something strange here is why @cache_coherent is not a simple
	 * boolean, i.e coherent vs non-coherent. The reasoning for this is back
	 * to the display engine not being fully coherent. As a result scanout
	 * surfaces will either be marked as I915_CACHE_NONE or I915_CACHE_WT.
	 * In the case of seeing I915_CACHE_NONE the kernel makes the assumption
	 * that this is likely a scanout surface, and will set @cache_coherent
	 * as only I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ, on platforms with the shared
	 * LLC. The kernel uses this to always flush writes through the CPU
	 * cache as early as possible, where it can, in effect keeping
	 * @cache_dirty clean, so we can potentially avoid stalling when
	 * flushing the surface just before doing the scanout.  This does mean
	 * we might unnecessarily flush non-scanout objects in some places, but
	 * the default assumption is that all normal objects should be using
	 * I915_CACHE_LLC, at least on platforms with the shared LLC.
	 *
	 * Supported values:
	 *
	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ:
	 *
	 * On shared LLC platforms, we use this for special scanout surfaces,
	 * where the display engine is not coherent with the CPU cache. As such
	 * we need to ensure we flush any writes before doing the scanout. As an
	 * optimisation we try to flush any writes as early as possible to avoid
	 * stalling later.
	 *
	 * Thus for scanout surfaces using I915_CACHE_NONE, on shared LLC
	 * platforms, we use:
	 *
	 *	cache_coherent = I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ
	 *
	 * While for normal objects that are fully coherent, including special
	 * scanout surfaces marked as I915_CACHE_WT, we use:
	 *
	 *	cache_coherent = I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ |
	 *			 I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE
	 *
	 * And then for objects that are not coherent at all we use:
	 *
	 *	cache_coherent = 0
	 *
	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE:
	 *
	 * When writing through the CPU cache, the GPU is still coherent. Note
	 * that this also implies I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ.
