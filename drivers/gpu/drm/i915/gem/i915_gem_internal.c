 * i915_gem_object_create_internal: create an object with volatile pages
 * @i915: the i915 device
 * @size: the size in bytes of backing storage to allocate for the object
 *
 * Creates a new object that wraps some internal memory for private use.
 * This object is not backed by swappable storage, and as such its contents
 * are volatile and only valid whilst pinned. If the object is reaped by the
 * shrinker, its pages and data will be discarded. Equally, it is not a full
 * GEM object and so not valid for access from userspace. This makes it useful
 * for hardware interfaces like ringbuffers (which are pinned from the time
 * the request is written to the time the hardware stops accessing it), but
 * not for contexts (which need to be preserved when not active for later
 * reuse). Note that it is not cleared upon allocation.
