	  Choose this option if you have a system that has "Intel Graphics
	  Media Accelerator" or "HD Graphics" integrated graphics,
	  including 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G, 915G, 945G, 965G,
	  G35, G41, G43, G45 chipsets and Celeron, Pentium, Core i3,
	  Core i5, Core i7 as well as Atom CPUs with integrated graphics.

	  This driver is used by the Intel driver in X.org 6.8 and
	  XFree86 4.4 and above. It replaces the older i830 module that
	  supported a subset of the hardware in older X.org releases.

	  Note that the older i810/i815 chipsets require the use of the
	  i810 driver instead, and the Atom z5xx series has an entirely
	  different implementation.

	  If "M" is selected, the module will be called i915.

	help
	  This is the default value for the i915.force_probe module
	  parameter. Using the module parameter overrides this option.

	  Force probe the driver for new Intel graphics devices that are
	  recognized but not properly supported by this kernel version. It is
	  recommended to upgrade to a kernel version with proper support as soon
	  as it is available.

	  Use "" to disable force probe. If in doubt, use this.

	  Use "<pci-id>[,<pci-id>,...]" to force probe the driver for listed
	  devices. For example, "4500" or "4500,4571".

	  Use "*" to force probe the driver for all known devices.

config DRM_I915_CAPTURE_ERROR

	help
	  This option enables capturing the GPU state when a hang is detected.
	  This information is vital for triaging hangs and assists in debugging.
	  Please report any hang to your Intel representative to help with triaging.

	  If in doubt, say "Y".

	default y
	help
	  This option selects ZLIB_DEFLATE if it isn't already
	  selected and causes any error state captured upon a GPU hang
	  to be compressed using zlib.

	  If in doubt, say "Y".

	default n
	help
	  Choose this option if you want to enable Intel GVT-g graphics
	  virtualization technology host support with integrated graphics.
	  With GVT-g, it's possible to have one integrated graphics
	  device shared by multiple VMs under different hypervisors.

	  Note that at least one hypervisor like Xen or KVM is required for
	  this driver to work, and it only supports newer device from
	  Broadwell+. For further information and setup guide, you can
	  visit: http://01.org/igvt-g.

	  Now it's just a stub to support the modifications of i915 for
	  GVT device model. It requires at least one MPT modules for Xen/KVM
	  and other components of GVT device model to work. Use it under
	  you own risk.

	  If in doubt, say "N".

	default y
	help
	  PXP (Protected Xe Path) is an i915 component, available on GEN12 and
	  newer GPUs, that helps to establish the hardware protected session and
	  manage the status of the alive software session, as well as its life
	  cycle.

       help
	 Choose this option if you want to add support for debugger (gdb) to
	 attach into processes using i915 and debug the gpu/gpgpu programs.
	 With debugger support, i915 will provide interface for a debugger
	 process to track, inspect and modify resources.

	  address space between a process and the GPU. SVM is supported
	  on both integrated and discrete Intel GPUs.
