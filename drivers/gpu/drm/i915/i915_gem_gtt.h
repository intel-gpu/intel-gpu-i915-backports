/*
 * Binding flags (common with i915_vma.flags).
 *
 * Bits 10/11 are copied into the i915_vma and used to track the vma usage.
 *
 * On gen5; there is only GGTT and we merely track whether the vma is intended
 * to be used by the kernel or by userspace, but is otherwise functionally
 * useless. We will make the vma as bound by USER | GLOBAL to avoid rebinds.
 *
 * On gen6/7, there is an aliasing-ppGTT. A single ppGTT overlaid on top of the
 * GGTT to give isolation between the kernel and user access (but doesn't allow
 * for isolation between different users). In this case, there is still a
 * single Global GTT that defines the address space for all, but now a second
 * ppGTT that uses the same i915_vma. Here, PIN_GLOBAL means create PTE in the
 * GGTT and PIN_USER means create PTE in the ppGTT.  The two flags create PTE
 * in the distinct GTT and so we need to track both binding. However, we only
 * ever bind with the GGTT vm.
 *
 * On gen8+, we have full per-process GTT (userspace) and the normal Global GTT
 * (kernel). We have full isolation between all users and kernel access. Here,
 * PIN_GLOBAL will only be used against the GGTT and PIN_USER against the
 * ppGTT. This then allows us to repurpose the PIN_GLOBAL bit on ppGTT to
 * indicate whether or not the binding storage has been allocated for this
 * i915_vma, aka PIN_RESIDENT. This is used by the pagefault enabled vm to make
 * vma binding a two step process. On the first step, the vma->node is reserved
 * and we may bind the faulting-scratch pages into that node depending on the
 * vm configuration. At this stage, we only mark the vma bound with PIN_USER;
 * it is not resident. The second step is then to bind the backing store into
 * the vma upon receiving a fault for that address. This second pass uses
 * PIN_RESIDENT. The vma is completely bound (the PTE point to the user's
 * backing store) once both PIN_RESIDENT | PIN_USER are set.
