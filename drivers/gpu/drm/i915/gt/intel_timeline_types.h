/*
 * Every context has a flow of requests that we track using breadcrumbs
 * written by the individual requests that show their current status:
 * whether they have finished waiting for all other requests and have
 * started the user payload, or wheter that request has finished
 * the user payload and has signaled its completion. This sequence of
 * requests and their breadcrumbs forms the timeline.
 *
 * Each context is independent of any other context, and we wish to
 * easily reorder the execution of the contexts, so we want to
 * store the breadcrumb of each context in a separate location. The most
 * flexible approach is to allocate each timeline a slot in a common
 * page (that we reallocate upon demand), as we can then move the
 * timeline whenever we need (such as restarting the breadcrumb sequence
 * after a wrap). Sometimes we do not need the flexibilty to reallocate
 * upon demand, and can use a static slot, for which we can utilise
 * the ppHWSP inside logical ring contexts (gen8+). For perma-pinned
 * kernel contexts, we cannot reallocate a timeline / status page
 * on demand, and so must always use a static slot. Here, we use
 * the per-engine global HWSP available on all generations.
