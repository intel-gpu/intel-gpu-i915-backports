          history of each topology reference/dereference will be printed to the
          kernel log once a port or branch device's topology refcount reaches 0.

	  user-space program handling the fbdev buffer.
	  This affects, not only, Amlogic, Allwinner or Rockchip devices
	  with ARM Mali GPUs using an userspace Blob.
	  This option is not supported by upstream developers and should be
	  removed as soon as possible and be considered as a broken and
	  legacy behaviour from a modern fbdev device driver.

	  Please send any bug reports when using this to your proprietary
	  software vendor that requires this.

	  monitor are unable to provide appropriate EDID data. Since this
	  feature is provided as a workaround for broken hardware, the
