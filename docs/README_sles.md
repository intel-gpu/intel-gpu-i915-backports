# SLES Supported OS Kernel/Distribution
  Our current backport supports the following OS Distribution.

| OS Distribution | OS Version | Kernel Version  |
|---  |---  |---  |
| SLES | 15SP4 | Kernel 5.14 |

  The kernel header used at the time of backporting may not be compatible with the latest version at the time of installation.
  Please refer [Version](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports/blob/backport/main/versions) file to get information on the kernel version being used during backporting.

  In case of an issue with the latest kernel, please install the kernel version mentioned in version file for appropriate OS version.

For SLES15SP4:
```
sudo zypper ref -s && sudo zypper install -y kernel-default-<SLES15_SP4_KERNEL_VERSION> \
kernel-syms-<SLES15_SP4_KERNEL_VERSION>

example:
       sudo zypper ref -s && sudo zypper install -y kernel-default-5.14.21-150400.24.11 \
       kernel-syms-5.14.21-150400.24.11
```

Please note that dkms installation will skip if the kernel headers are not installed.

# Prerequisite
we have dependencies on the following packages

For SLES
  - dkms
  - make
  - linux-glibc-devel
  - lsb-release
  - rpm-build
  - flex
  - bison
  - awk
```
sudo zypper install dkms make linux-glibc-devel lsb-release rpm-build bison flex awk
```

# Dependencies

This driver is part of a collection of kernel-mode drivers that enable support for Intel graphics. The backports collection within https://github.com/intel-gpu includes:

- [Intel® Graphics Driver Backports for Linux](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports) - The main graphics driver (includes a compatible DRM subsystem and dmabuf if necessary)
- [Intel® Converged Security Engine Backports](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-cse-backports) - Converged Security Engine
- [Intel® Platform Monitoring Technology Backports](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-pmt-backports/) - Intel Platform Telemetry
- [Intel® GPU firmware](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-firmware) - Firmware required by intel GPUs.

Each project is tagged consistently, so when pulling these repos, pull the same tag.


# Dynamic Kernel Module Support(DKMS) based package creation

## SLES
There are two ways to create i915 dkms packages.
1. Using default command:
```
$make i915dkmsrpm-pkg
example:
        $make i915dkmsrpm-pkg
        generated package name :
                intel-i915-dkms-0.6411.221110.0.5.14.21.150400.24.21-1.x86_64.rpm
```

2. Using os_distribution as an option :
```
$make i915dkmsrpm-pkg OS_DISTRIBUTION=<os-distribution>
example:
        $make i915dkmsrpm-pkg OS_DISTRIBUTION=VANILLA_5.15LTS
        generated package name :
                intel-i915-dkms-0.6411.221110.0.5.15.74-1.x86_64.rpm
```
  Above  will create rpm packages at $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/

 Use below help command to get the list of supported os distributions.

       $make i915dkmsrpm-pkg-help
       Rpm package contains the default kernel version (KV of SLES15_SP4)
       To create the package with specific kernel version, pass the supported kernel name to OS_DISTRIBUTION option

       ##### List of supported osv kernel versions #####
       SLES15_SP4
       VANILLA_5.15LTS

       Example: make i915dkmsrpm-pkg OS_DISTRIBUTION=SLES15_SP4

### Installation
 ```
sudo rpm -ivh intel-i915-dkms*.rpm
# Reboot the device after installation of all packages.
sudo reboot
```

## Installation verification

Please grep **backport**  from dmesg after reboot. you should see something like below
```
> sudo dmesg |grep -i backport
[    5.963854] COMPAT BACKPORTED INIT
