# Red Hat Supported OS Kernel/Distribution
  Our current backport supports the following OS Distribution.

| OS Distribution | OS Version | Kernel Version  |
|---  |---  |---  |
| RHEL | 9.2 | 5.14.0-284 |

  The kernel header used at the time of backporting may not be compatible with the latest version at the time of installation.
  Please refer [Version](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-i915-backports/blob/backport/RELEASE_2335_23.6/versions) file to get information on the kernel version being used during backporting.

  In case of any issue with the latest kernel, please install the kernel version mentioned in version file for appropriate OS version.

```
$sudo dnf check-update; sudo dnf install -y kernel-<RHEL_9.2_KERNEL_VERSION>.el9_2.x86_64 \
kernel-devel-<RHEL_9.2_KERNEL_VERSION>.el9_2.x86_64
Example:
     $sudo dnf check-update; sudo dnf install -y kernel-5.14.0-284.11.1.el9_2.x86_64 \
     kernel-devel-5.14.0-284.11.1.el9_2.x86_64

```

Please note that dkms installation will skip if the kernel headers are not installed.

## Prerequisite
We have dependencies on the following packages
  - make
  - linux-glibc-devel
  - rpm-build
  - flex
  - bison
  - awk
```
$sudo dnf install make linux-glibc-devel rpm-build bison flex awk
```
For dkms modules, we need to install `dkms` package also.

```
$sudo dnf install dkms
```

## Out of tree kernel drivers
This repository contains following drivers.
1. Intel® Graphics Driver Backports(i915) - The main graphics driver (includes a compatible DRM subsystem and dmabuf if necessary)
2. Intel® Converged Security Engine(cse) - Converged Security Engine
3. Intel® Platform Monitoring Technology(pmt/vsec) - Intel Platform Telemetry


## Dependencies

  These drivers have dependency on Intel® GPU firmware and few more kernel mode drivers may be needed based on specific use cases, platform, and distributions. Source code of additional drivers should be available at https://github.com/intel-gpu

- [Intel® GPU firmware](https://github.com/intel-gpu/intel-gpu-firmware) - Firmware required by intel GPUs.

Each project is tagged consistently, so when pulling these repos, pull the same tag.


## Package creation

### Dynamic Kernel Module Support(DKMS)
There are two ways to create i915 dkms packages.
1. Using default command:
```
$make i915dkmsrpm-pkg
Example:
        $make i915dkmsrpm-pkg

    Generated package name :
                 intel-i915-dkms-1.23.6.24.230425.29-1.x86_64.rpm
```

2. OS distribution option:

    Adds OS kernel version as part of dkms pacakge name.

```
$make i915dkmsrpm-pkg OS_DISTRIBUTION=<OS Distribution>
Example:
        $make i915dkmsrpm-pkg OS_DISTRIBUTION=RHEL_9.2

      Generated package name :
        intel-i915-dkms-1.23.6.24.5.14.0-284.11.1.29-1.x86_64.rpm
```
  Use below help command to get the list of supported os distributions.
```
$make dkms-pkg-help

Generated outout:
   DKMS Targets:
    i915dkmsrpm-pkg  -  Build DKMS rpm package

   ##### List of RPM supported osv kernel versions #####
   RHEL_9.2
```
Above  will create rpm packages at $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/

### Binary RPM
Creation of binary rpm can be done using the below command. By default it will use header of booted kernel, However it can be pointed to other headers via optional KLIB and KLIB_BUILD arguement
```
$make KLIB=<Header Path> KLIB_BUILD=<Header Path> binrpm-pkg

Exmaple:
$make KLIB=/lib/modules/$(uname -r) KLIB_BUILD=/lib/modules/$(uname -r) binrpm-pkg

Generated Files:
intel-i915-<version>.$(uname -r)-1.x86_64.rpm
```

## Installation
```
$sudo rpm -ivh intel-i915*.rpm
# Reboot the device after installation of all packages.
$sudo reboot
```
## Known limitation
KVGMT is not supported on Server Gfx cards so we need to blacklist KVGMT, on later version due to KVMGT refactoring
we may have unknown symbol warning during dkms installation.

Example:
```
depmod: WARNING: /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/kvmgt.ko.xz needs unknown symbol intel_gvt_set_ops
depmod: WARNING: /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i915/kvmgt.ko.xz needs unknown symbol intel_gvt_clear_ops
```
Blacklist kvmgt to avoid kvmgt module load during kernel boot.
```
sudo grubby --update-kernel=/boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) --args="modprobe.blacklist=kvmgt"
```

## Installation verification

Please grep **backport** from dmesg after reboot. you should see something like below
```
> sudo dmesg |grep -i backport
[    5.963854] COMPAT BACKPORTED INIT
[    5.968761] Loading modules backported from I915-23.6.24

[    6.069699] [drm] I915 BACKPORTED INIT
```
