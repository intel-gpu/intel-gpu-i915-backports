Releases for Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) targeting 5.17-OEM kernel.

# Tested configurations
5.17-OEM kernel:
    Repository: https://git.launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-oem/+git/jammy
    Branch:     origin/oem-5.17-next
    Commit:     b70ef9e9eb8cc

# Prerequisites
Ensure that 5.17-OEM headers are installed or are available.
If you've already installed the 5.17-OEM kernel and headers,
you can omit the KLIB and KLIB_BUILD environment variables from the build step.
In the example, I'm working with a 5.17-OEM kernel located and built in `../jammy`

# Building
$ make -j`nproc` KLIB=../jammy KLIB_BUILD=../jammy defconfig-i915
$ make -j`nproc` KLIB=../jammy KLIB_BUILD=../jammy

There are a couple warnings that are expected, but the build should complete.

# Installing
$ make KLIB=../jammy KLIB_BUILD=../jammy install

# Creating a Debian DKMS package
$ dpkg-buildpackage
$ dh clean

The DKMS package will be created in `../`.


# NOTES
Currently i915 'selfetsts' are non functional. If you enable them (using the defconfig 'deconfig-i915_selftest')
you will encounter a compilation warning elevated to an error (-Wall). To fix this, disable 'selftest' for i915.

As mentioned earlier, 2 warnings are expected during compilation.
