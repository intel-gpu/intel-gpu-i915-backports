# backport Kconfig
#
# Some options are user-selectable ("BPAUTO_USERSEL_*")
#
# Most options, however, follow a few different schemes:
#
# A) An option that is selected by drivers ("select FOO") will be
#    changed to "select BPAUTO_FOO" (if the option BPAUTO_FOO
#    exists). The option BPAUTO_FOO then controls setting of the
#    BPAUTO_BUILD_FOO option, which is a module, like this:
#
# config BPAUTO_BUILD_FOO
#	tristate
#	# or bool
#
#	# not possible on kernel < X.Y, build will fail if any
#	# drivers are allowed to build on kernels < X.Y
#	depends on KERNEL_X_Y
#
#	# don't build the backport code if FOO is in the kernel
#	# already, but only if the kernel version is also >= X.Z;
#	# this is an example of backporting where the version of
#	# the FOO subsystem that we need is only available from
#	# kernel version X.Z
#	depends on !FOO || KERNEL_X_Z
#
#	# build if driver needs it (it selects BPAUTO_FOO)
#	default m if BPAUTO_FOO
#
#	# or for build-testing (BPAUTO_USERSEL_BUILD_ALL is enabled)
#	default m if BPAUTO_USERSEL_BUILD_ALL
#
# config BPAUTO_FOO
#	bool
#
# This only works as-is if the kernel code is usable on any version,
# otherwise the "&& !FOO" part needs to be different.
#
#
# B) An option for code always present on some kernels (e.g. KFIFO).
#    This simply depends on/sets the default based on the version:
#
# config BPAUTO_BUILD_KFIFO
#	def_bool y
#	depends on KERNEL_2_6_36
#
#
# C) similarly, a kconfig symbol for an option, e.g.
#    BPAUTO_OPTION_SOME_FIX (no examples provided) check git log
#
#
# Variations are obviously possible.
#

config BP_MODULES
	option modules
	bool
	default MODULES

	help
	This symbol is necessary for the newer kconf tool, it looks
	for the "option modules" to control the 'm' state.
