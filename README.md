#  Intel® Graphics Driver Backports for Linux® OS (intel-gpu-i915-backports)

Contains the backported i915 Source Code of intel GPUs on various OSV Kernels.
You can create Dynamic Kernel Module Support(DKMS) based packages, which can be installed on supported OS distributions.

These out of tree i915 kernel module source codes are generated by the backpoprt project.
